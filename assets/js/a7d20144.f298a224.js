The firmware for RF 2.1 uses version number 4.4.x.\\n\\nSwashplate wiggle indications\\nThe swashplate is now indicating the FC readiness by doing a wiggle. Also, any errors or arming\\nfailures are now clearly indicated. Currently there are four different kind of wiggles:\\n\\n- FC ready to be armed\\n- Arming temporarily disabled\\n- Arming permanent failure\\n- Armed succesfully (disabled by default)\\n- FBUS support\\n- With help from FrSky, FBUS is now officially supported.\\n\\n- SBUS2 support\\n- Futaba SBUS2 telemetry is now available on the F7 and H7 targets.\\n\\n- SBUS Output support\\n- SBUS output is available as a tech preview, on CLI only. It allows expanding the number of servo outputs\\n- with an expander, or using SBUS servos directly.\\n\\n- Tx/Rx pinswap for serial ports\\n- A support for swapping the Tx/Rx pins on serial receivers, ESC telemetry,  \\n  and transmitter telemetry UARTs have been added.\\n\\n- ESC Forward Programming support - A support for ESC Forward Programming has been added. So far, four ESC vendors/models are supported:\\n- Hobbywing Platinum V5\\n- Scorpion\\n- YGE\\n- FlyRotor\\n- BB logging for ESC telemetry\\n- Three new BB log options have been added: ESC, BEC and ESC2.\\n- These options are logging the data received from the ESC(s).\\n\\nOther Changes\\n\\n- Allow RPM filter Q up to 25\\n- Add Graupner ESC telemetry\\n- Add RPM (freq) input edge and pull parameters\\n- Add model_id and MSP_PILOT_CONFIG for Lua integration\\n- Add more SmartPort sensors\\n- Add gov_min_throttle for nitro\\n- Add Adjustments for ACC trims\\n- Improved PID defaults\\n- Improved Rates defaults\\n- Improved Cyclic Cross-Coupling\\n- Improved Govnernor precomps\\n- Improved BB headers\\n- Improved battery voltage filtering\\n- Fix adjfunction initilisation bug\\n- Fix RPM filter update rate calculation\\n- Fix lost S.Port telemetry issue\\n- Fix UART bidir mode pull-up on F4\\n- Fix beep on disarm\\n- Various CMS fixes"},{"id":"/Official Release
