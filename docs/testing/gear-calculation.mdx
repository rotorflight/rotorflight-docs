# Two-Stage Gear Train Ratios

Having an accurate gear ratio for the main and tail rotor is essential for Rotorflight accurate RPM Filters performance.

Therefore it is best to count the tooth on the main and tail gear/pulley reduction sets and enter the values into the configurator.

This is relatively easy in single stage drive train that are used on most helicopters.

Broadly there are two types of two-stage ratios which are dependant on where the tail gear is connected. 

## Type 1 - Two-stage gears

Many SAB and ALIGN helicopters use this method.

Chose your helicopter and modify the motor pinion to match what you are installing.

## Type 2 - Two-stage gears

Chose your helicopter and modify the motor pinion to match what you are installing.

## Calculations
The following is a description is some details for the calculations used above. This can be used if you wish to calculate the ratios yourself.

### Type 1
For example for the SAB ilGoblin 700 with STD 21T motor pulley, the calculation will be as follow:

    **SAB ilGoblin 700** 

    **z1:**  21 teeth  
    **z2:**  56 teeth  
    **z3:**  18 teeth  
    **z4:**  68 teeth  
    **z5:**  34 teeth  
    **z6:**  26 teeth  

* `motor pinion` = *(Z1 x Z3)* = *(21 x 18)* = `378`.
* `main gear` = *(Z2 x Z4)* = *(56 x 69)* = `3808`.
* `tail pulley` = *(Z3 x Z6)* = *(18 x 26)* = `468`.
* `front pulley` = *(Z4 x Z5)* = *(69 x 34)* = `2312`.

`    378    ` : `    3808   ` Calculated Main Ratio  
`    468    ` : `    2312   ` Calculated Tail Ratio

### Type 2

For example for the KDS Agile A5 with STD 21T motor pulley, the calculation will be as follow:

    **KDS Agile A5** 

    **z1:**  21 teeth  
    **z2:**  54 teeth  
    **z3:**  17 teeth  
    **z4:**  66 teeth  
    **z5:**  57 teeth  
    **z6:**  14 teeth  

* `motor pinion` = *(Z1 x Z3)* = *(21 x 17)* = `357`.
* `main gear` = *(Z2 x Z4)* = *(54 x 66)* = `3564`.
* `tail pulley` = *(Z6)* = *(14)* = `14`.
* `front pulley` = *(Z5)* = *(57)* = `57`.

`    357    ` : `    3564   ` Calculated Main Ratio  
`    14     ` : `     57    ` Calculated Tail Ratio

### Type 3

This gear train type has a two-stage Main rotor and two-stage tail ratios. This design was used for helicopters such as the Gaui Hurricane.

    **Gaui Hurricane**

    **z1:**  13 teeth  
    **z2:**  42 teeth  
    **z3:**  19 teeth  
    **z4:**  61 teeth  
    **z5:**  14 teeth  
    **z6:**  9 teeth  
    **z7:**  9 teeth  

* `motor pinion` = *(Z1 x Z3)* = *(13 x 19)* = `247`.
* `main gear` = *(Z2 x Z4)* = *(42 x 61)* = `2562`.
* `tail pulley` = *(Z5 x Z7)* = *(14 x 9)* = `126`.
* `front pulley` = *(z4*z6)* = *(61 x 9)* = `549`.

`    247    ` : `    2562   ` Calculated Main Ratio  
`    126     ` : `    549    ` Calculated Tail Ratio
