# Getting Started

The general process for setting up a helicopter using Rotorflight.

This process is generic and may be slightly different, depending on your particular helicopter.

1. Install the latest RF2 [release](../setup/flashing-the-firmware.mdx#install-rotorflight-configurator)
2. [Remap](../setup/remapping.mdx) your servos and motors if you are using a Betaflight FC, otherwise, skip this step.
3. [Calibrate the Accelerometer](../configurator/tabs/setup.md#calibrate-accelerometer).
4. Check you [Board alignment](../configurator/tabs/configuration.md#board-and-sensor-alignment) setting and adjust if necessary.
5. Connect [Receiver](../configurator/tabs/receiver.mdx) to a free UART and select corresponding receiver settings.
6. Select [Battery Voltage and Current Source](../configurator/tabs/power.md#battery) as per you setup, and Set Battery [Capacity](../configurator/tabs/power.md#capacity) and [Cell Count](../configurator/tabs/power.md#cell-count).
7. Select [ESC Throttle protocol](../configurator/tabs/motors.md#esc-throttle-protocol), and Optional: [ESC Telemetry protocol](../configurator/tabs/motors.md#esc-telemetry-protocol), Set [Gear Ratios](../configurator/tabs/motors.md#gear-ratio-configuration), and [Motor Pole Count](../configurator/tabs/motors.md#motor-pole-count).
8. Optional: Select and Setup the [Governor](../setup/governor.md).
9. Setup [Servos](../setup/setup-servos.mdx).
10. Setup and Calibrate the [Mixer](../setup/setup-mixer.mdx).
11. Setup the [Gyro RPM Filters](../setup/rpm-filters.md#basic-rpm-filters-settings).
12. Set the [Rates](../configurator/tabs/rates.md) as per flying style.
13. Set the [PID](../configurator/tabs/profiles.md#pid-controller-gains) Values.
14. Setup [ARMING](../configurator/tabs/modes.md#arm), and other required modes.
15. Setup [Profile Switching](../setup/profile-switching-example.md) and other [Adjustments](../configurator/tabs/adjustments.md) if required.
16. Setup [BLACKBOX](../configurator/tabs/blackbox.md#what-is-blackbox) Logging.
