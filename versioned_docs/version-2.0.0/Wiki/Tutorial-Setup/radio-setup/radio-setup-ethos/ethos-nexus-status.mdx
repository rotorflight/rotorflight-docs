The ARM and IDLE-UP switch positions MUST be entered as per your Rotorflight configurator setup, in this example SE is ARM (Motor) and SD is IDLE-UP or Throttle Enable. Delay before active is the time taken for your motor to reach idle-up RPM. Current measurements will be started after this timeout.

TIMER CONFIGURATION

![Ethos](./img/ethos-status-8.jpg)

This is a count UP timer and will alarm at the set point, you can disable if using another Ethos timer.

BATTERY CONFIGURATION

TELEMETRY ANNOUNCEMENTS

![Ethos](./img/ethos-status-11.jpg)

Similar to the above, allows the status widget to play various Telemetry announcements depending on your TX switch positions, this could include, for example, using the rear panel SJ momentary switch to announce Fuel and/or Voltage.

GOVERNOR ANNOUNCEMENTS

![Ethos](./img/ethos-status-12.jpg)

Similar to the above but recommended to enable as per your preferences.These are primarily intended for use when using the Rotorflight Governor - If using an External ESC governor you will receive basic announcements of ARMED, DISARMED, ACTIVE and THROTTLE OFF.

ADVANCED OPTIONS

![Ethos](./img/ethos-status-16.jpg)

This is where you select Rotorflight Internal or an External governor for the widget, as well as any temp conversion from Centigrade to Fahrenheit.

The Voltage section allows you to choose how sensitive the low voltage alarms will be depending on the voltage sag whilst in flight.The sag compensation is a time delay before the alarms are announced.

Gimbal monitor effectively monitors your stick positions based on the drop down selection, and alerts if the given value is met. Normally disabled.

The Headspeed option allows you to set the announcement which will tell you when the headspeed has changed, 10% default, usefull to monitor if the Governor is maintaining the requested headspeed during fast 3D manoeuvres. Could point to Governor PID tuning.

Calculate fuel locally can be used in the event your ESC does not send a current measurement.
