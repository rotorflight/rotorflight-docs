# Contributing to Rotorflight

Rotorflight is an Opensource project. Contribution from other like minded people, keen to assist in making this software even better is welcomed and encouraged. You do not have to be a hardcore programmer to help. Lots of things can be done by anyone with a spare heli and some eagerness to learn and teach others. If you have the skills and time to contribute to some of the activities below please contact us through the [Discord](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd) and we can chat about the options.

## Translations

There are heaps of opportunities to translate the language files to provide the Configurator in your language. This can be both to update current languages or to add a new language.

## Flight testing/Crashing

Rotorflight gets better due to beta-testing code. Lots of things have to be tested and are constantly changing.
Some things are not working yet. Sometimes bugs are creeping into the code.

> **ANYBODY INVOLVED MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CRASHING IS UNAVOIDABLE.**

Maybe it's a bug, maybe it's a misconfiguration - it happens.

If you are still interested, we are currently looking for people with:

* a spare collective pitch helicopter
* good building skill, especially with electronics
* good enough flying skill to judge if things are working or not
* experience with drones and Betaflight is a major plus
* patience

## Documentation

Updating the website. Things are constantly changing, so the website has to update to match. If you have developed your skills to the point where you can assist in telling others how it all works then we would love assistance in keeping this resource up to date.
