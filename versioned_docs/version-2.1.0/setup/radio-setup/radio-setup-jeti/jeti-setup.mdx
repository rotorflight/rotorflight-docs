# Jeti example 

:::info[Rotorflight Jeti Setup]
Instructions for Jeti Initial Radio and Configurator Setup, this is a generic setup using a Frsky transmitter with a jeti exbus receiver with a Rotorflight FC. This example shows a Nexus; however, the process is the same for any Rotorflight controller. Please choose the SBUS port related to your FC.

## Wiring
The simplest is to use a male to male servo lead to connect from the ***SBUS*** port on the FBL to the ***E1*** port on your receiver.
