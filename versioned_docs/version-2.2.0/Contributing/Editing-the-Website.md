There are two ways you can Edit the Rotorflight Website. Directly online through the Github project repository or locally on your machine

## Online Editing

This is probably the easiest and most straightforward way to make changes. At the bottom of each page there is an **Edit this page** button. Click on this link to take you to the project folder on Github.

## Adding a new page

Download one of the current pages. Open the Markdown (.MD) file in an Editor. At the top of the file change the **Sidebar\_Position** to position your new page where you wish it to be in the sidebar. The current pages are numbered with a spacing of 10 so there are free spaces for new pages between each.

Once complete **add File** and upload the new page.
